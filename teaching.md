# CS 1371 Computing for Engineers

From August 2017 to December 2018 I was a TA for
[CS1371](https://cs1371.gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech.

In addition to teaching duties, I designed and wrote most of the [test case
compiler](https://github.com/CS1371/homework-compiler/tree/master/TestCaseCompiler),
a tool used by TAs to create homework problems. I also contributed to
the [autograder](https://github.com/CS1371/autograder), which we used
to grade students' homework automatically.
