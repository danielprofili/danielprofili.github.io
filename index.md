# Research

## Tropical resultants

Suppose we have polynomials $$f_1, \dots, f_n \in \mathbb{C}[x_1,
\dots, x_m],$$ each of the form

$$f_i = b_{i, 1} x_1^a_{i,1} + \dots + b_{i, m} x_m^a_{i, m},$$

where $$b_{i,k} \in \mathbb{C}$$ and $$a_{i, k} \in \mathbb{Z}.$$ What
can we say about the choices of coefficients $$b_{i,k}$$ which satisfy
$$f_1 = \dots = f_n = 0$$?
