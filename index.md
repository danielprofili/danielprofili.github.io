# About

My name is Daniel Profili, and I am a first year mathematics PhD student at NC State University.

# Contact

You can reach me at `daprofil@ncsu.edu` or `dprofili at
protonmail dot com`.

# Research

I'm interested in algebraic geometry and number theory, particularly when computers are involved. My undergraduate thesis was about the combinatorial structure of certain polytopes in 4 and 5 dimensions, which you can read about [here](https://danielprofili.github.io/research.html).

In the past I've also been involved in a project [using neural networks to simulate molecular interactions](https://github.com/danielprofili/quantum-chemistry-neuralnetwork) and another project in which I helped [design algorithms for processing ultrasound images](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b02105).
