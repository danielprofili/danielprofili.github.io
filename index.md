# About

My name is Daniel Profili, and I am a mathematics PhD student at
NC State University. My advisor is [Hoon Hong](https://hong.math.ncsu.edu/).

# Contact

You can reach me at `daprofil@ncsu.edu`.

# Research

I'm interested in computer algebra, combinatorics, and geometry. I'm
currently working on a project with [Hoon
Hong](https://hong.math.ncsu.edu/) and [J. Rafael Sendra](https://www.cunef.edu/en/sendra-pons-juan-rafael/) about generalizing Descartes' rule of signs. 

<!-- In the past I've been involved in a project [using neural networks to simulate molecular interactions](https://github.com/danielprofili/quantum-chemistry-neuralnetwork) and another project in which I helped [design algorithms for processing ultrasound images](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b02105). -->
<!-- My [undergraduate thesis](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/64862/PROFILI-UNDERGRADUATERESEARCHOPTIONTHESIS-2021.pdf?sequence=1) was about the combinatorial structure of certain polytopes in 4 and 5 dimensions, which you can read about [here](https://danielprofili.github.io/research.html). -->
