## Tropical resultants

Suppose we have polynomials $$f_1, \dots, f_n \in \mathbb{C}[x_1,
\dots, x_m],$$ each of the form

$$f_i = b_{i, 1} x_1^{a_{i,1}} + \dots + b_{i, m} x_m^{a_{i, m}},,$$

where $$b_{i,k} \in \mathbb{C}$$ and $$a_{i, k} \in \mathbb{Z}.$$ What
can we say about the choices of coefficients $$b_{i,k}$$ which satisfy
$$f_1 = \dots = f_n = 0$$?

As it turns out, there is a unique polynomial called the *resultant*
which is defined as a polynomial $$R$$ of
the coefficients such that $$R(b_{1,1}, \dots, b_{n, m}) = 0$$ if and
only if the $$b_{i, j}$$'s satisfy $$f_1 = \dots = f_n = 0$$.
